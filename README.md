#### 📝 Description
A twist on the classic "Where's Waldo" game. In this case, you're searching for Nintendo characters from the GameCube era. This project was used as a way for me to practice using a BaaS like Firebase, and to get more practice implementing unit testing in React.

#### 💡 Features
* Timer to record how fast a user can beat the game
* Character components stored/grabbed with Firebase to prevent cheating through dev tools.
* Dynamic character cordinates based on window size.

#### 🛠️ Built with 
 * React
 * React Router
 * SCSS
 * Jest
 * Firebase
